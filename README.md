# Find_the_Roots
A lesson on finding the roots of a quadratic equation using the quadratic formula.

by Kheng Lin Khoo

This is my first Python project.

Python file: Find_the_Roots.py

For more information about the Python code I wrote, please read Find_the_Roots_KLKhoo_Python_Project.pdf

This PDF document describes the lesson and code structure, shows example outputs and discusses future improvements I could implement.


I wrote this to teach my son how to find the roots of a quadratic equation.

He was delighted that I was inspired to write my first Python project for him.

He will be less delighted that he now has plenty of opportunity to practice this topic in algebra.
